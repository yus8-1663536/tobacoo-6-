# Project Description

### Purpose of Research Project

The purpose of our research project is to portray the consequences of smoking behavior (e.g. smoking-related diseases) and how prevalent they are among different demographics. We would like to demonstrate how smoking can be the gateway to numerous severe issues that can jeopardize one's life (portrayed via mortality measurements). 
Research

[Global Burden of Disease Due to Smokeless Tobacco Consumption in Adults; analysis from 113 countries](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12916-015-0424-2)

This article was found on The Lancet and looks at the Global Burden of Disease due to consumption of smokeless tobacco by adults across 113 countries. And with the research and analysis provided, it gives us more data and work on tobacco (in a non-smoking sense)

[Smoking prevalence and attributable disease burden in 195 countries and territories, 1990-2015: a systematic analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361730819X)

This article was found on The Lancet and observes the daily smoking prevalence by gender, age group, and year for 195 countries and territories from 1990-2015. It also analyzes 38 risk-outcome pairs to generate estimates of smoking-attributable mortality and disease burdens (which is measured and defined by DALYs)

[Patterns of global tobacco use in young people and implications for future chronic disease burden in adults](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673606681920?casa_token=Kl-KM2d6G8sAAAAA:f2RrV9YRwkO6tBuzp_5yqPBi-9qtv0gjcO91PuSyzlrRNo7C03FJLPM-cFZneI78X2bZ46kLhQ)

This article was found on a volume from The Lancet and it specifically focuses on the impact and effect of tobacco use by young people on global mortality. The study utilized a survey, denoted as the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS), which was taken by 13-15 year olds at 395 sites in 131 different countries, the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

### Datasets

https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/tobacco-use

This dataset was found on Kaggle, and the data itself was collected by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). It contains information about prevalence of tobacco use from 1995-2010 in the United States.

This dataset was found on healthdata.gov, and the data itself was collected by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). It contains information about health care expenditures that are linked to cigarette smoking among adults.

This dataset was found on healthdata.gov, and the data itself was collected by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). It contains information about mortality rates that are attributable to cigarette smoking-related diseases. 

### Target Audience

There are quite a few different audiences that our data can entangle. Each audience presents its own advantages. The first potential audience is smokers who regularly purchase tobacco products. By targeting this audience, we can shape our data to show them potential consequences of becoming a life-long smoker. This can include characteristics like health consequences, socioeconomic effects, and perhaps even social relationships. Another potential audience for our project is health officials. By presenting our data to health officials, perhaps they can use it as helpful material to engage in various studies surrounding smoking-related diseases. A third audience could be just the general public that includes smokers and non-smokers. This audience could be effective by allowing us to present our data to a massive amount of people, who can then share it with others and allow our data to have a farther reach than any of the other audiences.

For the purposes of our project, we will likely focus on targeting the audience of the general public in order to have the largest effect on the general population.

### What Should Our Audience Learn (Questions Answered)

Our audience can learn a number of valuable lessons from looking at our data. We want the general public to be better informed about the effects of tobacco on people's short and long term health. Some questions that can be answered include:

How have smoking-related diseases changed over time?

Which smoking-related disease is the most prevalent?

Which smoking-related disease has the highest mortality percentage?

How have different smoking-related diseases affected a person's health over time?

How do smoking-related diseases vary in different geographical areas?

# Technical Description

### Final Product Format

We are going to create an interactive page for our project. Basically, it will end up with a HTML file including the introduction of our research topic, the explanation of health burden metrics as well as the analysis of the relevant statistics of smoking-related diseases and the interactive visualizations.
Data-related Challenges

We anticipate we will encounter challenges of collecting relevant data of smoking-related disease in global scope. Considering that the measurement of disease burden metrics differ from countries, it is incredibly critical for us to take the margin of error of the statistics into consideration and try to minimize them as much as possible.

### New Technical Skills

To make our project compelling and informative, we should be proficient in writing R markdown files and be familiar with the packages and R syntax when making interactive plots. 

### Major Challenges

We anticipate the major challenges will be the process of aggregating data and transferring them into desired visualization plots afterwards.
